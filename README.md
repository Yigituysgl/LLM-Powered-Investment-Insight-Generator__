# LLM-Powered-Investment-Insight-Generator__
An AI-powered Streamlit dashboard that combines market signals, sentiment analysis, and LLM intelligence to generate daily investment insights. Overview: This project integrates financial data analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver real-time market insights. It visualizes key stock metrics (price, signals, RSI, MACD, sentiment) and uses an LLM to automatically generate an interpretable daily market report for investors or analysts.

⚠️ Important Note : 
This repository does not include the Jupyter Notebook file used for exploration and experimentation.
The notebook contained sensitive API setup instructions (e.g., Groq API key) that must remain private.
All final and reproducible code has been safely integrated into the app.py file for transparency and functionality.
Security
The .env file containing API keys is not uploaded for security reasons.
This project follows best practices for secret management.
The app uses python-dotenv to load keys locally, keeping credentials secure.

⚠️ Disclaimer:

!!! This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It does not provide financial, investment, or trading advice. !!! All insights generated by the model are hypothetical and should not be used for making real-world investment decisions.
